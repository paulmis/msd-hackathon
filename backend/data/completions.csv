www.kitepower.nl,Full Description,"Kitepower is a leading start-up in airborne wind energy, developing innovative and cost-effective alternatives to existing wind turbines by using kites to generate electricity. Its patented technology is a game-changer in the wind energy sector; it uses 90% less material while being twice as efficient than existing technology. Unlike conventional wind turbines, the Kitepower system does not require resource-intensive towers or heavy foundations and is thus easy to transport and deploy. The system is able to harness stronger and more persistent winds at higher altitudes, allowing for capacity factors greater than 0.5 and in return cost-effective electricity generation, this opens up new geographical markets for the generation of wind energy. The 100kW system currently in development is ideally suited to replace diesel generator sets in remote locations to save costs and mitigate dependency on diesel supply. Kitepower was founded by Johannes Peschel and Roland Schmehl in January 2016 as a result of the work done by TU Delft’s pioneering kite power research group of the former astronaut Wubbo Ockels. Already in 2007, the first 20kW Kitepower system demonstrated the proof of concept. The 100kW system Kitepower is currently developing will be one of the first airborne wind energy systems available on the market. Kitepower is a growing team of TU Delft researchers and strong industry partners with a collective vision to reinvent wind energy."

Many conventional methods to deter birds are animal unfriendly, inefficient in the long term and a cause of nuisance for the environment. This calls for innovation. Instead of dealing with the symptoms by just scaring birds, Bird Control Group actively contributes to providing long term solutions focused on integrating commercial activities into the natural environment."

This issue costs the industry over twenty-five billion US dollars per year. HCI has since developed and marketed the idea for the 4FOLD foldable shipping container. The company is a spinoff from the Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands. In 2009, funded by private investors with a long term vision, HCI built a first prototype of the foldable container together with co-funder and co-creator CMA-CGM. This prototype served as a proof of concept. Two years later, in 2011, HCI built a new prototype that received the important Container Safety Convention (CSC) certification. In close cooperation with a Chinese manufacturer, HCI built another redesigned and improved container in 2013. In March of that year, 4FOLD was the first 40ft foldable container in the world to receive ISO certification. This ISO certificate finally guarantees that the foldable container meets all industry requirements and paves the way for use in the existing logistic system."

They do this by implementing force-feedback technology on ship control. At Smart-Ship we implement force-feedback/haptics on ship controls to increase safety, sustainability and efficiency during maritime operations. With our haptic lever series we enable a shared control where the human operator intuitively knows what to do during complex maritime operations. In this way we form a bridge towards autonomous shipping. Please see our website for more information: https://www.smart-ship.eu"

mobbr.com,Full Description,"Getting work done better, faster and cheaper. That's what every business wants and what they could easily achieve if they would make their processes more social. Think Github or Wikipedia. But most businesses still don't work like that and fail to utilize the enormous potential of crowdsourced labor. Why? A major hurdle is that 'social collaboration' requires a totally different reward system. Mobbr is a unique payment system that helps businesses to make the transition to that new, much more effective way of working and organizing. With Mobbr it takes only one click to pay out 'social salary'. Real money, but distributed based on 'social' participation in business processes. To the crowd: groups of people that contribute to a task or collaboration. Anywhere on the internet. Mobbr will radically change the way that people work and earn money. Collaboration platforms are the offices and factories of the future. And in that future a significant part of the salaries worldwide will be 'social' and run through their platform.

Agriculture will have to double food production to sustain the global population, with fewer resources and lower environmental impact. No technology exists to achieve this target. They founded SOLHO to bridge this gap. They developed an innovative system called SPRHOUT (Solar-PoweRed Horticultural Off-grid UniT). The SPRHOUT uses Sun and available water sources (e.g., sea or sewage) to generate all the streams required to operate a greenhouse facility: electricity, heating/cooling, fresh water, and CO2."

Course participants experience a virtual incident scenario as extremely realistic. The stress felt during exercises is considerable, because the problem situations that arise fully match reality.

skyframes.nl,Full Description,Skyframes is a young and rapidly growing company. Skyframes was founded a year ago by students Daniel Kist en Wichert Kooloos. Due to their technical background in respectively industrial design and civil engineering they came in contact with multicopters. The goal of Skyframes is to perform technical inspections with multicopters. Because of their technical education and their elaborate knowledge of multicopters they are able to develop new inspection methods together with their clients. Currently they are focusing in performing blade inspections of on- and offshore wind turbines but together with their clients they keep on developing new methods for other inspection purposes. Their passion for cinematography should not be forgotten. Skyframes strives to create the most spectacular aerial shots for all segments in the film industry. Examples of many of their projects can be found on their projects page.
